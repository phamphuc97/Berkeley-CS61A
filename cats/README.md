# Cat Project

The Cat Project (a.k.a Autocorrected Typing Software) is a programming project that involves building a a program that measures typing speed. It allows users to practice typing text passages and measures their typing speed in words per minute (WPM). The goal of the project is to help students gain experience with Python programming and to build their skills in procedural programming.

# Getting Started

To use the typing program, first, clone or download the repository to your local machine.

The main program is ```cats_gui.py```. You can run the program by opening a terminal window in the directory where the program is saved and typing ```python cats_gui.py```.

The program will then display text passage to practice typing. You can generate a new text passage by clicking the Restart button.

Once you've selected a passage, the program will begin measuring your typing speed. It will display the passage in the interactive window, and you will need to type it as accurately and quickly as possible. The program will keep track of your typing speed and display it at the end.
